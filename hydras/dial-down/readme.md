# Hydras Dial Down scripts

This work has been cancelled. The purpose was to study the behavior of the DHT routing tables after the hydras leave the DHT. However, they will continue participating in the DHT, hence this study doesn't make sense for now.

These scripts could be useful in the future, if we decide to remove the Hydras completely. This will require further work to get the scripts working.
